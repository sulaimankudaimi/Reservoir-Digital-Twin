# 🚀 Deep-Earth Digital Twin Platform (DEDT)
### **Lead Architect: Sulaiman Kudaimi**
*Next-Gen Reservoir Monitoring & Predictive Simulation System*

## 🌐 Project Overview
The **Deep-Earth Digital Twin** is an integrated reservoir management platform designed to provide a high-fidelity 3D visualization and predictive analysis of oil and gas assets. Developed by **Sulaiman Kudaimi**, this system bridges the gap between static geological data and dynamic production physics.
